Overview

With the development of Linked Data, large amounts of biological pathway RDF data have been published on the semantic Web. To make these various datasets available to life scientists, we demonstrate an interactive tool, called BioPW, for the biological pathway Linked Data visualization. In contrast to showing the biological pathway data merely from one dataset, our tool, with the Open PHACTS Linked Data API and users' exploratory interaction, could clearly illustrate the biological pathways with their associated information from multiple perspectives of linked datasets.% and the data provenances.
